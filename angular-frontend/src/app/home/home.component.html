    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold text-center">Personal Property Database</h2>
    <p class="lead text-secondary text-center">Made with Java, Postgres, and Angular</p>
    <p>The purpose of this app is to serve as a place to enter and store information about personal possessions in case an insurance claim needs to be filed. </p>
    <p>The back end of this app is built using Java with a Spring Boot framework and Maven as the build tool, while the database is Postgres. The front end is controlled using Angular, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Special attention has been paid to using the responsive design tools available in Bootstrap to ensure a mobile-first design.</p>
    <p>Future plans for the app include adding sorting and filtering, data export to CSV, and a barcode scanner functionality with lookup to a product database.</p>
